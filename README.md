Basic Wordpress Multisite plugin that facilitates quickly switching from one site to another while remaining on the same page.

*Example:*
1. In a network you have 2 sites (blogs): Site A and Site B. 
2. You are on the Writing settings page of Site A ( http://sitea.com/wp-admin/options-writing.php )

If you go to My Sites > Site B > Switch to Domain you'll end up on the corresponding page in Site B, which would be http://siteb.com/wp-admin/options-writing.php
